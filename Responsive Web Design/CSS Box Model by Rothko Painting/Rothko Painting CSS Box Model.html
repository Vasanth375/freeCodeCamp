<!-- In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case, 
a header, paragraph, or image element. Image URL(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-2.png)
The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.
Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in.

Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.
Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page.
Now that you understand the CSS box model, let's get started on the Rothko painting.

Every painting needs a frame

padding is to adjust the spacing within an element. padding shorthand will increase the space between .frame and .canvas. 
The shorthand will increase space in the top, bottom, left, and right of the element's border and canvas within.

margins to adjust the spacing outside of an element.
vertical margin of 20px, and horizontal margin of auto. This will move the frame down 20 pixels and horizontally center it on the page.

The border-radius property accepts up to four values to round the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners.
Ex: border-radius: 30px 25px 60px 12px;

Rotate each rectangle to give them more of an imperfect, hand-painted look. 
Use the transform property on the .one selector to rotate it counter clockwise by 0.6 degrees.
Ex: transform: rotate(-0.6deg); counter clock means minus(-) image transforms from right to left, only clockwise left to right positive(+)
